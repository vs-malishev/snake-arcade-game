# snake-arcade-game
 
 (ES6) implementation of the "snake" arcade game

#Setup

- Install dependencies `npm install`

#Running on your desktop

- do an `npm start` from terminal in the root directory 

1. To make this game fully functional I need to implement and output total score, what do when user wins or loses.
One of the ideas was to use the panel on the right to output the messaging.

2. I also need to configure SCSS and properly style the page.
